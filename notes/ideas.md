# Stack Store

We are a platform that enables vendors to capitalize on promotions

* We have to create a store with a promotion engine

    * Kickstarter similar idea:
    * Giving users rewards for share a deal.
        * Allow products to be a deal.

        * Black Friday idea?
            * You want that bust open idea
            * Storm in and take deals
            * Build quick anticipation

        * Everyone is gaining something from sharing
            * Almost like Kickstarter

        * Tiered Costs:
            * If a products costs $100 and we get 1000 likes then it costs $90

        * Price goes down for anyone who has liked it
            * Get the liked price!!!


### THINKING POINT
**Social media as currency or a coupon**


* Adding Gamificaition:
    * Tracking users shares and their share's conversions.

* Hype a product

* Problems
    * Limiting users by only allowing users who like it.


* Basic User Functionality

    - Buyer / Consumer

    - Seller / Brand
