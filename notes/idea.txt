**** Stack Store ****

* We are a platform that enables vendors to capitalize on promotions

* We have to create a store with a promotion engine

    ** Kickstarter similar idea:
        - Giving users rewards for share a deal.
            - Allow products to be a deal.

        - Black Friday idea?
            - You want that bust open idea
            - Storm in and take deals
            - Build quick anticipation

        - Everyone is gaining something from sharing
            - Almost like Kickstarter

        - Tiered Costs:
            - If a products costs $100 and we get 1000 likes then it costs $90

        - Price goes down for anyone who has liked it
            - Get the liked price!!!


    *** THINKING POINT ***
        - Social media as currency or a coupon


    ** Adding Gamificaition:
        - Tracking users shares and their share's conversions.

    ** Hype a product

    - Problems
        - Limiting users by only allowing users who like it.


* Basic User Functionality

* Buyer
* Seller
